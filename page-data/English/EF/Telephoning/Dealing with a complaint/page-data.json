Thanks for your time.\n\n\n## Dealing with an angry caller\n\n### Expression: Calming the client\n\n**Calming an angry caller**\n\nWhen talking to an angry customer, the most important thing is to keep calm.

You can use these highlighted phrases to do so.\n\n- **I can see how that would be most** frustrating.\n- **I understand completely.**\n- **I'd feel exactly the same way if** I were you.\n\nOr you can show empathy by commenting on the situation as though you feel the same way as the customer. You can use these highlighted adjectives with negative meanings.\n\n- That's **terrible.**\n- This really is **unacceptable.**\n\nYou can also show empathy with an apology.\n\n- **I'm sorry you had to** go through all this trouble.\n  \nDon't forget to confirm that you've got the full picture of the issue.\n\n**Let me just make sure I've understood** the whole situation.

Show empathy to encourage them to explain what's wrong. Notice that empathy is expressed not only by the language used but also by the sincere tone of the speaker.\n\n- I'm terribly sorry to hear that.\n\nUse these sentences to help the customer explain the situation in an organized way.\n\n- Let's start from the beginning. \n- Can you take me through the problem step by step? \n\nUse **I take it that** to confirm what's being implied.\n\n- **I take it that** we've failed to live up to your expectations? \n\nThe customer is more likely to share information if they think you'll act on it.\n\n- Tell me what happened, please, and **I'll see what I can do to resolve the situation**.\n\n### Listening: Listening for key words\n               \nKnowing what to listen for helps you better understand what others are saying. You can do this by making predictions based on the topic. If someone complains about a hotel room, they may mention its hygiene or facilities. If it's about the facilities, listen for facility names, such as Wi-Fi, air conditioner or shower, and words describing problems, such as broken, leaking or doesn't work.\n\nAlso listen for the words that carry important meaning in sentences, usually verbs, nouns and adjectives. Listen for words with a negative meaning, too, like never and none.\n\n\n- There's a **terrible smell** in the **bathroom**, and the **sink** is **leaking**.\n- I called the **front desk**, but they **never came**.\n\n### Expression: Resolving a complaint\n\n**Resolving complaints**\n\nThe best way to handle complaints is to give solutions. You can start with this sentence.\n\n- I have a proposal.\n  \nUse **furthermore** to add to your proposal.\n\n- **Furthermore**, this work will be done free of charge.  \n  \nUse these sentences to ask for the customer's opinion.\n\n- I'd like to know what you think.  \n- How does that sound?\n- Is there anything else I can do?\n\nIt's also important to maintain a relationship with the client. Here are some useful sentences to apologize and to express wishes for the future.\n\n- Once again, let me apologize for this situation.\n- I sincerely hope that we will still fulfill your expectations.\n- I hope this won't deter your company from working with us.   \n- I promise to look into it to ensure it never happens again.\n \n:::\nMR. ST. JOHN: I have a proposal. I'd like to know what you think. I'll send our chief designer, Julian, over to assess the situation and propose a new design. How does that sound ?\n\nMS. LAMBERT: That would be a start.\n\nMR. ST. JOHN: Furthermore , we'll send a team of painters to work directly with you. I sincerely hope that we can fulfill your expectations.\nMS. LAMBERT: The work had better be done fast. I have bookings awaiting confirmation.\nMR. ST. JOHN: We'll make sure that it's done in time. Once again, let me apologize.

LAMBERT: No, I think that's all. I'll be waiting for his call.\n:::\n\n## Leaving a voice message\n\n### Expression: Leaving a voice message\n\n**Recording a voice message**\n\nAn efficient voice message is brief and contains only necessary information.

Tom is on it this week and should have it ready soon.\n  \n:::\nHey Claire, this is Ron. I got your email. I tried to call you but couldn't get through. So, you were asking about the proposal.

Please get back to me when you hear this message. Chat soon.\n:::\n\n### Expression: Interpreting what someone wrote\n\n**Interpreting what's written**\n\nIt's not uncommon to find a few sentences that aren't clear in an email.

Talk soon!\n:::\n\n**Follow-up actions**\n\nBefore finishing your voice message, tell the other person what actions are expected afterward. **Follow up** is a very common action phrase, often using **with** and **on**.\n\n- I'll **follow up with** Stuart **on** the legal papers.\n\nHere are more action phrases highlighted with accompanying prepositions.\n\n- I need to **confirm** the new plan **with** Jane.\n- Let's **sync up on** the meeting agenda.\n- I'd like to **clarify** a few things with you.\n- We should **put a hold on** the project.\n\nFinally, you can ask the other person to respond.
